## Project Introduction:
For our project, we are aiming to implement our own version of decision tree machine laerning. We wanted to work on this project in order to get a more in depth understanding of how decision trees work and how they can be optimized to run most efficiently by using Rust. Our goal is to have a working model by the end of the semester that can accurately classify various types of inputted data.

## Technical Overview:
### Checkpoint 1:
Develop an algorithm/function that splits the dataset and calculates information gain using entropy or the Gini Index.
### Checkpoint 2:
Implement the decision tree itself by using the algorithm created in checkpoint 1 to build the tree.
### Final Submission:
Test the model with predefined datasets by checking to see how accurate its predictions are.

## Possible Challenges:
Some possible challenges we may encounter are our model overfitting the data leading to inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, as this is a complex project, we may get stuck while figuring out the best practice ways of implementing the model.
