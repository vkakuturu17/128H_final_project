## Project Introduction:
For our project, we have pivoted to focusing on an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path between nodes of a weighted graph. We are deciding to do this project because this is a very fundamental algorithm that we know will be taught in future courses, so we wanted to get a head start on understanding it.

## Technical Overview: (these checkpoints are no longer accurate because we recently re-pivoted on our project idea)
### Checkpoint 1:
Develop an algorithm/function that splits the dataset and calculates information gain using entropy or the Gini Index.
### Checkpoint 2:
Implement the decision tree itself by using the algorithm created in checkpoint 1 to build the tree.
### Final Submission:
Test the model with predefined datasets by checking to see how accurate its predictions are.

## Possible Challenges:
Some possible challenges we may encounter are some of the ownership limitations in Rust, as we have previously implemented this algorithm in other languages, but never in a language as challening as Rust.
